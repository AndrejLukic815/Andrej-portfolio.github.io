## My previous work

---

## Education
I have graduated from law school in Croatia in 2018, 2 years later I have applied for a job as a 112 operator in my hometown.

In 2020 I got a degree in my profession as after one year on probation work I had to take an exam for this position.

When 2021 came along I started to participate in 6 month-long education about Game Development.

1 of August 2021 I finished education and got a diploma in Game Development.

## My accomplishments
I have participated in many game jams that include locally in my community or global games jams in a variety of game jam themes.

Recently in Croatia ManpowerGroup and GameChuck organized a game jam with a theme to make a simulation in Unity.

I and my team won that competition and were also rewarded with a bonus place for the most innovative and realistic simulation in that competition.

The purpose of this competition is to reward the best team with a cash reward and also offer them an opportunity to work on this project from the competition.
