### Some information about me: 

[](/sample_page)

Hi, my name is Andrej Lukić and I am a game developer from Croatia.

I started to get in-game development about 3 years ago when I decided I wanted to make games.

Video games are my passion so I wanted to turn them into a real job for me.

I was born in a small town named Vukovar situated near the Danube river.

I finished law high school in Vukovar.

As I started working in the law industry I quickly realize that I didn’t want to spend my entire life working on a job that I don't like.

So I decided to quit my job and pursue my dream of becoming a game developer.

Now my dream has become a reality as I have just started to enter the gaming industry.

This is just the beginning of my story and I hope it will have a happy ending in the industry.

### What have I achieved:

I have participated in many game jams that include locally in my community or global games jams in a variety of game jam themes.

Recently in Croatia ManpowerGroup and GameChuck organized a game jam with a theme to make a simulation in Unity.

I and my team won that competition and were also rewarded with a bonus place for the most innovative and realistic simulation in that competition.

The purpose of this competition is to reward the best team with a cash reward and also offer them an opportunity to work on this project from the competition.

After the competition ended we were offered a business offer by GameChuck to work with them on this project.

The GameChuck LTD is a very successful gaming company in Croatia and working with them was very exciting and very productive.

I gained a lot of experience working with them on this project.

### Games that I worked on:

<img src="images/Photo_Cat_Picture.png?raw=true"/>
Just Photo Cat is a game that was made for Ludum dare game jam the theme of the jam was deeper and deeper.

This project involved 5 people including me as an audio designer.

The game was made in 48 hours, after the game was finished it contained some bugs, we fixed most of them but still, some of them remained.

As this project was only made for the game jam we didn't work much on it as we wanted to make a game that we could put in our portfolio.
