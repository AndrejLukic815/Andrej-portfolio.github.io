[About Me:](/sample_page)
<img src="images/Testna_Slika.png?raw=true"/>
Hi my name is Andrej LukiÄ‡ and I am a game developer from Croatia.
I started to get in game development about 3 years ago when I decided I wanted to make games.
The video games are my passion so I wanted to turn it into a real job for me.
I was born in small town named Vukovar situated near Danube river.
I finished law high school in Vukovar.
As I started working in law industry i quickly realise that i didn't want to spend my entire life working on a job that i dont like.
So I decided to quit my job and pursue my dream of becoming a game developer.
Now my dream have becom a reallity as I have just started to enter into the gaming industry.
This is just a beginning of my story and I hope it will have a happy ending in the industry.

Just Photo Cat is a game that was made for Ludum dare game jam the theme of the jam was deeper and deeper.
In this project were involved 5 people including me as audio designer.
The game was made in 48 hours after the game was finished it contained some bugs we fixed most of them but still some of them remained.
As this project was only made for game jam we didn't work much on it as we wanted to make a game that we could put in our portfolio.
